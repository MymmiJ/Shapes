## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - Check the code style with ``$ composer check-style`` and fix it with ``$ composer fix-style``. --this has pretty much fallen by the wayside but it's an aspiration.

- **Document any change in behaviour**

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.



## Running Tests

``` bash
$ composer test
```
